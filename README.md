Cascade FX (Alpha Demo)
=================
Version 0.1
Programmed by Gameblabla

A tetris-like game with software rendered 3D graphics for the NEC PC-FX :)
Programmed in C with liberis.

Use the Dpad to control the pieces (A to rotate).


Installation
=============

For real hardware, you can either :
- Use a dev cartridge like David Shadoff's (in which case you won't get any CDDA music)
- Burn the game to a CD with imgburn (Burn on an old CLV drive with good CD-R media if possible)

TODO:
- Redo music
- Add sound effects
- Add more puzzles in puzzle mode
- Possibly improve text handling
